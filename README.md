# personal_tools_for_WGS
These are all my personal tools I code for using in WGS data analysis

# DO_recomptes_reads.py: 
This script analyze the relative frequency of each event (read for each base, insertion, deletion...) for a given totalpileup file

  USAGE: python DO_recomptes_reads.py
      and follow further instructions given by the script itself.


# DO_split_multifasta.sh:
This script is to split one multifasta file into several singlefasta files into the same folder.

  USAGE: sh DO_split_multifasta.sh [FILE] [LINEAGE] [BASE_ROUTE]*
  
  *** You can change the value for BASE_ROUTE (ln.5) in the script to avoid the need to indicate the [BASE_ROUTE] every time you use the script (usually /home/computer_name) ***
